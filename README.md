For this homework I created a portfolio with the help of Bootstrap. Bootstrap is the most used CSS Framework.
Bootstrap is very useful for web developers because it allows them to create websites quicker 
by giving developers templates. Bootstrap is responsive and allows the websites to work across diffent devices such
as mobile, tablets, labtops and desktops. That means that no matter which device you're veiwing your website on, Bootstraps' framework allows you to view content unaltered. I created a portfolio about myself so that potential employers will be able to know more about me, I also provided links to my social media and a contact page for anyone looking to get ahold of me. Being visible to potential employers is instrument in standing out amoungnst other competitors.
